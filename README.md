# Edited Names File for OOTP19
OOTP19 removed the cap on names in the database, so you can't use these files in an older version because the game won't be able to support it. I decided to share my edited names files, because it's a lot of work and I figured someone else would want to use them but wouldn't want to have to exact the effort of adding names galore they might not use.

Here are the name files I know I've added:

- English Caribbean
- Dutch Carib
- French Carib
- Ukrainian
- Filipino
- North African
- Swahili
- Central Asia
- Laotian
- Estonian
- Icelandic
- Australian update
- Lithuanian
- Cuban
- Dominican
- Persian

I also balanced the ratios of ethnicities for many of these since many of them are horribly wrong and it annoys me. You can make your own changes to these files to your liking, but this will at least save you lots of time having to do it manually. Or if you end up getting your files overwritten when the game updates, this can save you time. Feel free to fork and share your changes, too.

I edited the names, first_names, and world_default file to all match. I edited all countries and changed the percentage ethnicities to match what I could find from those who uploaded the names. I also included the historical and female names under the countries but put their percentage at 0. This allows them in the file but removes them from players who don't want them in their game. Those who do should be able to just adjust the percentages under the country and everything will work. 

I had to guess at some of the facegen percentages, so welcome anyone to edit those if need be.
